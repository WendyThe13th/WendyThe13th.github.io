[illustration] the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well": 101, " either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her": 102, " first, she tried to make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs": 103, " she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed": 104, " it was labeled \"orange marmalade,\" but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it": 105, " down, down, down! would the fall never come to an end? there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began talking to herself": 106, " \"dinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, i should think!\" (dinah was the cat": 107, ") \"i hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time": 108, " dinah, my dear, i wish you were down here with me!\" alice felt that she was dozing off, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over": 109, " alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment": 110, " she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it": 111, " there was not a moment to be lost": 112, " away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\" she was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen": 113, " she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof": 114, " there were doors all \u2019round the hall, but they were all locked; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again": 115, " suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass": 116, " there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and alice\u2019s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it would not open any of them": 117, " however, on the second time \u2019round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high": 118, " she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted! [illustration] alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw": 119, " how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway": 120, " \"oh,\" said alice, \"how i wish i could shut up like a telescope! i think i could, if i only knew how to begin": 121, "\" alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes": 122, " this time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said alice), and tied \u2019round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \"drink me\" beautifully printed on it in large letters": 123, " \"no, i\u2019ll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it\u2019s marked \u2019_poison_\u2019 or not,\" for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later": 124, " however, this bottle was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off": 125, " * * * * * \"what a curious feeling!\" said alice": 126, " \"i must be shutting up like a telescope!\" and so it was indeed! she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden": 127, " after awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried": 128, " \"come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\" said alice to herself rather sharply": 129, " \"i advise you to leave off this minute!\" she generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes": 130, " soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"eat me\" were beautifully marked in currants": 131, " \"well, i\u2019ll eat it,\" said alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, i can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, i can creep under the door: so either way i\u2019ll get into the garden, and i don\u2019t care which happens!\" she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"which way? which way?\" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size": 132, " so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake": 133, " [illustration] ii--the pool of tears \"curiouser and curiouser!\" cried alice (she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english)": 134, " \"now i\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! good-by, feet! oh, my poor little feet, i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you": 135, "\" just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door": 136, " poor alice! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever": 137, " she sat down and began to cry again": 138, " she went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all \u2019round her and reaching half down the hall": 139, " after a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming": 140, " it was the white rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other": 141, " he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"oh! the duchess, the duchess! oh! _won\u2019t_ she be savage if i\u2019ve kept her waiting!\" when the rabbit came near her, alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"if you please, sir--\" the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go": 142, " [illustration] alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking": 143, " \"dear, dear! how queer everything is to-day! and yesterday things went on just as usual": 144, " _was_ i the same when i got up this morning? but if i\u2019m not the same, the next question is, \u2019who in the world am i?\u2019 ah, _that\u2019s_ the great puzzle!\" as she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit\u2019s little white kid-gloves while she was talking": 145, " \"how _can_ i have done that?\" she thought": 146, " \"i must be growing small again": 147, "\" she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly": 148, " she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether": 149, " \"that _was_ a narrow escape!\" said alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence": 150, " \"and now for the garden!\" and she ran with all speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before": 151, " \"things are worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for i never was so small as this before, never!\" as she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water": 152, " her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea": 153, " however, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high": 154, " [illustration] just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself": 155, " \"would it be of any use, now,\" thought alice, \"to speak to this mouse? everything is so out-of-the-way down here that i should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying": 156, "\" so she began, \"o mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? i am very tired of swimming about here, o mouse!\" the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing": 157, " \"perhaps it doesn\u2019t understand english,\" thought alice": 158, " \"i dare say it\u2019s a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror": 159, "\" so she began again: \"o\u00f9 est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence in her french lesson-book": 160, " the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright": 161, " \"oh, i beg your pardon!\" cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings": 162, " \"i quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats": 163, "\" \"not like cats!\" cried the mouse in a shrill, passionate voice": 164, " \"would _you_ like cats, if you were me?\" \"well, perhaps not,\" said alice in a soothing tone; \"don\u2019t be angry about it": 165, " and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah": 166, " i think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her": 167, " she is such a dear, quiet thing": 168, "\" the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended": 169, " \"we won\u2019t talk about her any more, if you\u2019d rather not": 170, "\" \"we, indeed!\" cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail": 171, " \"as if _i_ would talk on such a subject! our family always _hated_ cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\" [illustration: alice at the mad tea party": 172, "] \"i won\u2019t indeed!\" said alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation": 173, " \"are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? there is such a nice little dog near our house, i should like to show you! it kills all the rats and--oh, dear!\" cried alice in a sorrowful tone": 174, " \"i\u2019m afraid i\u2019ve offended it again!\" for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went": 175, " so she called softly after it, \"mouse dear! do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\" when the mouse heard this, it turned \u2019round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, \"let us get to the shore and then i\u2019ll tell you my history and you\u2019ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs": 176, "\" it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures": 177, " alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore": 178, " [illustration] iii--a caucus-race and a long tale they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable": 179, " [illustration] the first question, of course, was how to get dry again": 180, " they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life": 181, " at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among them, called out, \"sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _i\u2019ll_ soon make you dry enough!\" they all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the mouse in the middle": 182, " \"ahem!\" said the mouse with an important air": 183, " \"are you all ready? this is the driest thing i know": 184, " silence all \u2019round, if you please! \u2019william the conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest": 185, " edwin and morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria\u2019--\" \"ugh!\" said the lory, with a shiver": 186, " \"--\u2019and even stigand, the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found it advisable\u2019--\" \"found _what_?\" said the duck": 187, " \"found _it_,\" the mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what \u2019it\u2019 means": 188, "\" \"i know what \u2019it\u2019 means well enough, when _i_ find a thing,\" said the duck; \"it\u2019s generally a frog or a worm": 189, " the question is, what did the archbishop find?\" the mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"\u2019--found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown": 190, "\u2019--how are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, turning to alice as it spoke": 191, " \"as wet as ever,\" said alice in a melancholy tone; \"it doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all": 192, "\" \"in that case,\" said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"i move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\" \"speak english!\" said the eaglet": 193, " \"i don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, i don\u2019t believe you do either!\" \"what i was going to say,\" said the dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race": 194, "\" \"what _is_ a caucus-race?\" said alice": 195, " [illustration] \"why,\" said the dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it": 196, "\" first it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there": 197, " there was no \"one, two, three and away!\" but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over": 198, " however, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the dodo suddenly called out, \"the race is over!\" and they all crowded \u2019round it, panting and asking, \"but who has won?\" this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought": 199, " at last it said, \"_everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes": 200, "\" \"but who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked": 201, " \"why, _she_, of course,\" said the dodo, pointing to alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded \u2019round her, calling out, in a confused way, \"prizes! prizes!\" alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them \u2019round as prizes": 202, " there was exactly one a-piece, all \u2019round": 203, " the next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back": 204, " however, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more": 205, " \"you promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said alice, \"and why it is you hate--c and d,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again": 206, " \"mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the mouse, turning to alice and sighing": 207, " \"it _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said alice, looking down with wonder at the mouse\u2019s tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:-- \"fury said to a mouse, that he met in the house, \u2019let us both go to law: _i_ will prosecute _you_": 208, "-- come, i\u2019ll take no denial: we must have the trial; for really this morning i\u2019ve nothing to do": 209, "\u2019 said the mouse to the cur, \u2019such a trial, dear sir, with no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath": 210, "\u2019 \u2019i\u2019ll be judge, i\u2019ll be jury,\u2019 said cunning old fury; \u2019i\u2019ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death": 211, "\u2019\" \"you are not attending!\" said the mouse to alice, severely": 212, " \"what are you thinking of?\" \"i beg your pardon,\" said alice very humbly, \"you had got to the fifth bend, i think?\" \"you insult me by talking such nonsense!\" said the mouse, getting up and walking away": 213, " \"please come back and finish your story!\" alice called after it": 214, " and the others all joined in chorus, \"yes, please do!\" but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker": 215, " \"i wish i had dinah, our cat, here!\" said alice": 216, " this caused a remarkable sensation among the party": 217, " some of the birds hurried off at once, and a canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \"come away, my dears! it\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\" on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone": 218, " \"i wish i hadn\u2019t mentioned dinah! nobody seems to like her down here and i\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world!\" poor alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited": 219, " in a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly": 220, " [illustration] [illustration] iv--the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; alice heard it muttering to itself, \"the duchess! the duchess! oh, my dear paws! oh, my fur and whiskers! she\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! where _can_ i have dropped them, i wonder?\" alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely": 221, " very soon the rabbit noticed alice, and called to her, in an angry tone, \"why, mary ann, what _are_ you doing out here? run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! quick, now!\" \"he took me for his housemaid!\" said alice, as she ran off": 222, " \"how surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who i am!\" as she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \"w": 223, " rabbit\" engraved upon it": 224, " she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves": 225, " by this time, alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass": 226, " she uncorked it and put it to her lips, saying to herself, \"i do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for, really, i\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\" before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken": 227, " she hastily put down the bottle, remarking, \"that\u2019s quite enough--i hope i sha\u2019n\u2019t grow any more": 228, "\" alas! it was too late to wish that! she went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor": 229, " still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself, \"now i can do no more, whatever happens": 230, " what _will_ become of me?\" [illustration] luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger": 231, " after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen": 232, " \"mary ann! mary ann!\" said the voice": 233, " \"fetch me my gloves this moment!\" then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs": 234, " alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it": 235, " presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as the door opened inwards and alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure": 236, " alice heard it say to itself, \"then i\u2019ll go \u2019round and get in at the window": 237, "\" \"_that_ you won\u2019t!\" thought alice; and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air": 238, " she did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort": 239, " next came an angry voice--the rabbit\u2019s--\"pat! pat! where are you?\" and then a voice she had never heard before, \"sure then, i\u2019m here! digging for apples, yer honor!\" \"here! come and help me out of this! now tell me, pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\" \"sure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honor!\" \"well, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!\" there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air": 240, " this time there were _two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass": 241, " \"i wonder what they\u2019ll do next!\" thought alice": 242, " \"as for pulling me out of the window, i only wish they _could_!\" she waited for some time without hearing anything more": 243, " at last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together": 244, " she made out the words: \"where\u2019s the other ladder? bill\u2019s got the other--bill! here, bill! will the roof bear?--who\u2019s to go down the chimney?--nay, _i_ sha\u2019n\u2019t! _you_ do it! here, bill! the master says you\u2019ve got to go down the chimney!\" alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next": 245, " the first thing she heard was a general chorus of \"there goes bill!\" then the rabbit\u2019s voice alone--\"catch him, you by the hedge!\" then silence and then another confusion of voices--\"hold up his head--brandy now--don\u2019t choke him--what happened to you?\" last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"well, i hardly know--no more, thank ye": 246, " i\u2019m better now--all i know is, something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box and up i goes like a sky-rocket!\" after a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and alice heard the rabbit say, \"a barrowful will do, to begin with": 247, "\" \"a barrowful of _what_?\" thought alice": 248, " but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face": 249, " alice noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head": 250, " \"if i eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it\u2019s sure to make _some_ change in my size": 251, "\" so she swallowed one of the cakes

birds waiting outside": 253, " they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood": 254, " [illustration: \"the duchess tucked her arm affectionately into alice\u2019s": 255, "\"] \"the first thing i\u2019ve got to do,\" said alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size

around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances": 257, " there was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself": 258, " she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else": 259, " [illustration] v--advice from a caterpillar at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed alice in a languid, sleepy voice": 260, " \"who are _you_?\" said the caterpillar": 261, " [illustration] alice replied, rather shyly, \"i--i hardly know, sir, just at present--at least i know who i _was_ when i got up this morning, but i think i must have changed several times since then": 262, "\" \"what do you mean by that?\" said the caterpillar, sternly": 263, " \"explain yourself!\" \"i can\u2019t explain _myself_, i\u2019m afraid, sir,\" said alice, \"because i\u2019m not myself, you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing": 264, "\" she drew herself up and said very gravely, \"i think you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first": 265, "\" \"why?\" said the caterpillar": 266, " as alice could not think of any good reason and the caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away": 267, " \"come back!\" the caterpillar called after her": 268, " \"i\u2019ve something important to say!\" alice turned and came back again": 269, " \"keep your temper,\" said the caterpillar": 270, " \"is that all?\" said alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could": 271, " \"no,\" said the caterpillar": 272, " it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"so you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\" \"i\u2019m afraid, i am, sir,\" said alice": 273, " \"i can\u2019t remember things as i used--and i don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\" \"what size do you want to be?\" asked the caterpillar": 274, " \"oh, i\u2019m not particular as to size,\" alice hastily replied, \"only one doesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know": 275, " i should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\" said alice": 276, " \"three inches is such a wretched height to be": 277, "\" \"it is a very good height indeed!\" said the caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high)": 278, " in a minute or two, the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"one side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter": 279, "\" \"one side of _what_? the other side of _what_?\" thought alice to herself": 280, " \"of the mushroom,\" said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight": 281, " alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it": 282, " at last she stretched her arms \u2019round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand": 283, " \"and now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect": 284, " the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot! she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit": 285, " her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit": 286, " \"come, my head\u2019s free at last!\" said alice; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her": 287, " \"where _have_ my shoulders got to? and oh, my poor hands, how is it i can\u2019t see you?\" she was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent": 288, " she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings": 289, " [illustration] \"serpent!\" cried the pigeon": 290, " \"i\u2019m _not_ a serpent!\" said

pleasing them!\" alice was more and more puzzled": 292, " \"as if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the pigeon, \"but i must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! and

wriggling down from the sky! ugh, serpent!\" \"but i\u2019m _not_ a serpent, i tell you!\" said alice": 293, " \"i\u2019m a--i\u2019m a--i\u2019m a little girl,\" she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day": 294, " \"you\u2019re looking for eggs, i know _that_ well enough,\" said the pigeon; \"and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\" \"it matters a good deal to _me_,\" said alice hastily; \"but i\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if i was, i shouldn\u2019t want _yours_--i don\u2019t like them raw": 295, "\" \"well, be off, then!\" said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest": 296, " alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could,

hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height": 298, " it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first": 299, " \"the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden--how _is_ that to be done, i wonder?\" as she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high": 300, " \"whoever lives there,\" thought alice, \"it\u2019ll never do to

out, the fish-footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky": 309, " alice went timidly up to the door and knocked": 310, " \"there\u2019s

middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup": 318, " \"there\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\" alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing": 319, " even the duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\u2019s pause": 320, " the only two creatures in the kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was grinning from ear to ear": 321, " \"please would you tell me,\" said alice, a little timidly, \"why your cat

alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror": 327, " \"here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the duchess said to alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke": 328, " \"i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen,\" and she hurried out of the room": 329, " alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in

alarm": 334, " this time there could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the

refreshments!\" the judge, by the way, was the king and he wore his crown over his great wig": 430, " \"that\u2019s the jury-box,\" thought alice; \"and those twelve creatures (some were animals and some were birds) i suppose they are the jurors": 431, "\" just then the white rabbit cried out \"silence in the court!\" \"herald, read the accusation!\" said the king": 432, " [illustration] on this, the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"the queen of hearts, she made some tarts, all on a summer day; the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts and took them quite away!\" \"call the first witness,\" said the king; and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out, \"first witness!\" the first witness was the hatter": 433, " he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other": 434, " \"you ought to have finished,\" said the king": 435, " \"when did you begin?\" the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the dormouse": 436, " \"fourteenth of march, i _think_ it was,\" he said": 437, " \"give your evidence,\" said the king, \"and don\u2019t be nervous, or i\u2019ll have you executed on the spot": 438, "\" this did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the queen, and, in his confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter": 439, " just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation--she was beginning to grow larger again": 440, " the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee": 441, " \"i\u2019m a poor man, your majesty,\" he began": 442, " \"you\u2019re a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the king": 443, " \"you may go,\" said the king, and the hatter hurriedly left the court": 444, " \"call the next witness!\" said the king": 445, " the next witness was the duchess\u2019s cook": 446, " she carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once": 447, " \"give your evidence,\" said the king": 448, " \"sha\u2019n\u2019t,\" said the cook": 449, " the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said, in a low voice, \"your majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness": 450, "\" \"well, if i must, i must,\" the king said": 451, " \"what are tarts made of?\" \"pepper, mostly,\" said the cook": 452, " for some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared": 453, " \"never mind!\" said the king, \"call the next witness": 454, "\" alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list": 455, " imagine her surprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \"alice!\" x--alice\u2019s evidence \"here!\" cried alice": 456, " she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below": 457, " \"oh, i _beg_ your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay": 458, " \"the trial cannot proceed,\" said the king, \"until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--_all_,\" he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at alice": 459, " \"what do you know about this business?\" the king said to alice": 460, " \"nothing whatever,\" said alice": 461, " the king then read from his book: \"rule forty-two": 462, " _all persons more than a mile high to leave the court_": 463, "\" \"_i\u2019m_ not a mile high,\" said

hastily": 467, " \"consider your verdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice": 468, " \"there\u2019s more evidence to come yet, please your majesty,\" said the white rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry": 469, " \"this paper has just been picked up": 470, " it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to--to somebody": 471, "\" he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"it

signed at the end": 473, "\" \"you _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man,\" said the king": 474, " there was a general clapping of hands at this": 475, " \"read them,\" he added, turning to the white rabbit": 476, " there was dead silence in the court whilst the white rabbit read out the verses": 477, " \"that\u2019s the most important

glimpse which i got of it from the train and the little i could walk through the streets": 510, " i feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible": 511, " the impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east; the most western of splendid bridges over the danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of turkish rule": 512, " we left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to klausenburgh": 513, " here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale": 514, " i had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty": 515, "_, get recipe for mina": 516, ") i asked the waiter, and he said it was called \"paprika

should be able to get on without it": 518, " having had some time at my disposal when in london, i had visited the british museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country": 519, " i find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, transylvania, moldavia and bukovina, in the midst of the carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of europe": 520, " i was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the castle dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey maps; but i found that bistritz, the post town named by count dracula, is a fairly well-known place": 521, " i shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my travels with mina": 522, " in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: saxons in the south, and mixed with them the wallachs, who are the descendants of the dacians; magyars in the west, and szekelys in the east and north": 523, " i am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from attila and the huns": 524, " this may be so, for when the magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it": 525, " i read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting": 526, "_, i must ask the count all about them": 527, ") i did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for i had all sorts of queer dreams": 528, " there was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty": 529, " towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then": 530, " i had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was \"mamaliga,\" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call \"impletata": 531, "\"

i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move": 534, " it seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains": 535, " what ought they to be in china? all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind": 536, " sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods": 537, " it takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear": 538, " at every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire": 539, " some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i saw coming through france and germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque": 540, " the women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist": 541, " they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them": 542, " the strangest figures we saw were the slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails": 543, " they wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches": 544, " they are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing": 545, " on the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands": 546, " they are, however, i am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion": 547, " it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz, which is a very interesting old place": 548, " being practically on the frontier--for the borgo pass leads from it into bukovina--it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it": 549, " fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions": 550, " at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease": 551, " count dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel, which i found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country": 552, " i was evidently expected, for when i got near the door i faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty": 553, " when i came close she bowed and said, \"the herr englishman?\" \"yes,\" i said, \"jonathan harker": 554, "\" she smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door": 555, " he went, but immediately returned with a letter:-- \"my friend": 556, "--welcome to the carpathians": 557, " i am anxiously expecting you": 558, " sleep well to-night": 559, " at three to-morrow the diligence will start for bukovina; a place on it is kept for you": 560, " at the borgo pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me": 561, " i trust that your journey from london has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land": 562, " \"your friend, \"dracula": 563, "\" _4 may": 564, "_--i found that my landlord had got a letter from the count, directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand my german": 565, " this could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did": 566, " he and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way": 567, " he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew": 568, " when i asked him if he knew count dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further": 569, " it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting": 570, " just before i was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way: \"must you go? oh! young herr, must you go?\" she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all": 571, " i was just able to follow her by asking many questions": 572, " when i told her that i must go at once, and that i was engaged on important business, she asked again: \"do you know what day it is?\" i answered that it was the fourth of may": 573, " she shook her head as she said again: \"oh, yes! i know that! i know that, but do you know what day it is?\" on my saying that i did not understand, she went on: \"it is the eve of st": 574, " george\u2019s day": 575, " do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?\" she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her, but without effect": 576, " finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting": 577, " it was all very ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable": 578, " however, there was business to be done, and i could allow nothing to interfere with it": 579, " i therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as i could, that i thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that i must go": 580, " she then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me": 581, " i did not know what to do, for, as an english churchman, i have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind": 582, " she saw, i suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, \"for your mother\u2019s sake,\" and went out of the room": 583, " i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck": 584, " whether it is the old lady\u2019s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, i do not know, but i am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual": 585, " if this book should ever reach mina before i do, let it bring my good-bye": 586, " here comes the coach! * * * * * _5 may": 587, " the castle": 588, "_--the grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills i know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed": 589, " i am not sleepy, and, as i am not to be called till i awake, naturally i write till sleep comes": 590, " there are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i left bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly": 591, " i dined on what they called \"robber steak\"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the london cat\u2019s meat! the wine was golden mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable": 592, " i had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else": 593, " when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and i saw him talking with the landlady": 594, " they were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning \"word-bearer\"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly": 595, " i could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so i quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out": 596, " i must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were \"ordog\"--satan, \"pokol\"--hell, \"stregoica\"--witch, \"vrolok\" and \"vlkoslak\"--both of which mean the same thing, one being slovak and the other servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire": 597, "_, i must ask the count about these superstitions) when we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me": 598, " with some difficulty i got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning that i was english, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye": 599, " this was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that i could not but be touched": 600, " i shall never forget the last glimpse which i had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard": 601, " then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey": 602, " i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had i known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, i might not have been able to throw them off so easily": 603, " before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road": 604, " there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by i could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals": 605, " in and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the \"mittel land\" ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame": 606, " the road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste": 607, " i could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching borgo prund": 608, " i was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows": 609, " in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order": 610, " of old the hospadars would not repair them, lest the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point": 611, " beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves": 612, " right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly": 613, " here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water": 614, " one of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:-- \"look! isten szek!\"--\"god\u2019s seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently": 615, " as we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us": 616, " this was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink": 617, " here and there we passed cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent": 618, " by the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves": 619, " here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world": 620, " there were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves": 621, " now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant\u2019s cart--with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road": 622, " on this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the cszeks with their white, and the slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end": 623, " as the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow": 624, " sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys": 625, " sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver\u2019s haste, the horses could only go slowly": 626, " i wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it": 627, " \"no, no,\" he said; \"you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep": 628, "\" the only stop he would make was a moment\u2019s pause to light his lamps": 629, " when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed": 630, " he lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions": 631, " then through the darkness i could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills": 632, " the excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea": 633, " i had to hold on": 634, " the road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along": 635, " then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the borgo pass": 636, " one by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye": 637, " then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness": 638, " it was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though i asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation": 639, " this state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on the eastern side": 640, " there were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder": 641, " it seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one": 642, " i was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count": 643, " each moment i expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark": 644, " the only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud": 645, " we could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle": 646, " the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment": 647, " i was already thinking what i had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which i could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; i thought it was \"an hour less than the time": 648, "\" then turning to me, he said in german worse than my own:-- \"there is no carriage here": 649, " the herr is not expected after all": 650, " he will now come on to bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day": 651, "\" whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up": 652, " then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a cal\u00e8che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach": 653, " i could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals": 654, " they were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us": 655, " i could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us": 656, " he said to the driver:-- \"you are early to-night, my friend": 657, "\" the man stammered in reply:-- \"the english herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:-- \"that is why, i suppose, you wished him to go on to bukovina": 658, " you cannot deceive me, my friend; i know too much, and my horses are swift": 659, "\" as he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory": 660, " one of my companions whispered to another the line from burger\u2019s \"lenore\":-- \"denn die todten reiten schnell\"-- (\"for the dead travel fast": 661, "\") the strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile": 662, " the passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself": 663, " \"give me the herr\u2019s luggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the cal\u00e8che": 664, " then i descended from the side of the coach, as the cal\u00e8che was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious": 665, " without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the pass": 666, " as i looked back i saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves": 667, " then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to bukovina": 668, " as they sank into the darkness i felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent german:-- \"the night is chill, mein herr, and my master the count bade me take all care of you": 669, " there is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it": 670, "\" i did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same": 671, " i felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened": 672, " i think had there been any alternative i should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey": 673, " the carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road": 674, " it seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so i took note of some salient point, and found that this was so": 675, " i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but i really feared to do so, for i thought that, placed as i was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay": 676, " by-and-by, however, as i was curious to know how time was passing, i struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight": 677, " this gave me a sort of shock, for i suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences": 678, " i waited with a sick feeling of suspense": 679, " then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear": 680, " the sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night": 681, " at the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright": 682, " then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for i was minded to jump from the cal\u00e8che and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting": 683, " in a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them": 684, " he petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as i have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled": 685, " the driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace": 686, " this time, after going to the far side of the pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right": 687, " soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side": 688, " though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along": 689, " it grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket": 690, " the keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way": 691, " the baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side": 692, " i grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear": 693, " the driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but i could not see anything through the darkness": 694, " suddenly, away on our left, i saw a faint flickering blue flame": 695, " the driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness": 696, " i did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey": 697, " i think i must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare": 698, " once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us i could watch the driver\u2019s motions": 699, " he went rapidly to where the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device": 700, " once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same": 701, " this startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, i took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness": 702, " then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle": 703, " at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright": 704, " i could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light i saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair": 705, " they were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled": 706, " for myself, i felt a sort of paralysis of fear": 707, " it is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import": 708, " all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them": 709, " the horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it": 710, " i called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach": 711, " i shouted and beat the side of the cal\u00e8che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap": 712, " how he came there, i know not, but i heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway": 713, " as he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still": 714, " just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness": 715, " when i could see again the driver was climbing into the cal\u00e8che, and the wolves had disappeared": 716, " this was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and i was afraid to speak or move": 717, " the time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon": 718, " we kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending": 719, " suddenly, i became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky": 720, " chapter ii jonathan harker\u2019s journal--_continued_ _5 may": 721, "_--i must have been asleep, for certainly if i had been fully awake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place": 722, " in the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is": 723, " i have not yet been able to see it by daylight": 724, " when the cal\u00e8che stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight": 725, " again i could not but notice his prodigious strength": 726, " his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen": 727, " then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone": 728, " i could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather": 729, " as i stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings": 730, " i stood in silence where i was, for i did not know what to do": 731, " of bell or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate": 732, " the time i waited seemed endless, and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon me": 733, " what sort of place had i come to, and among what kind of people? what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked? was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor\u2019s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner? solicitor\u2019s clerk! mina would not like that": 734, " solicitor--for just before leaving london i got word that my examination was successful; and i am now a full-blown solicitor! i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if i were awake": 735, " it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and i expected that i should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as i had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork": 736, " but my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived": 737, " i was indeed awake and among the carpathians": 738, " all i could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning": 739, " just as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light": 740, " then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back": 741, " a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back": 742, " within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere": 743, " he held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door": 744, " the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent english, but with a strange intonation:-- \"welcome to my house! enter freely and of your own will!\" he made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone": 745, " the instant, however, that i had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man": 746, " again he said:-- \"welcome to my house": 747, " come freely": 748, " go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring!\" the strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which i had noticed in the driver, whose face i had not seen, that for a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was speaking; so to make sure, i said interrogatively:-- \"count dracula?\" he bowed in a courtly way as he replied:-- \"i am dracula; and i bid you welcome, mr": 749, " harker, to my house": 750, " come in; the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest": 751, "\" as he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage; he had carried it in before i could forestall him": 752, " i protested but he insisted:-- \"nay, sir, you are my guest": 753, " it is late, and my people are not available": 754, " let me see to your comfort myself": 755, "\" he insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily": 756, " at the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and i rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared": 757, " the count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort": 758, " passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter": 759, " it was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney": 760, " the count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door:-- \"you will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your toilet":

welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears": 764, " having then reached my normal state, i discovered that i was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty toilet, i went into the other room": 765, " i found supper already laid out": 766, " my host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said:-- \"i pray you, be seated and sup how you please": 767, " you will, i trust, excuse me that i do not join you; but i have dined already, and i do not sup": 768, "\" i handed to him the sealed letter which mr": 769, " hawkins had entrusted to me": 770, " he opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read": 771, " one passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure": 772, " \"i must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady i am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come; but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom i have every possible confidence": 773, " he is a young man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition": 774, "

i had two glasses, was my supper": 778, " during the time i was eating it the count asked me many questions as to my journey, and i told him by degrees all i had experienced": 779, " by this time i had finished my supper, and by my host\u2019s desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke": 780, " i had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy": 781, " his face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere": 782, " his eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion": 783, " the mouth, so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years": 784, " for the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin": 785, " the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor": 786, " hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing them now close to me, i could not but notice that they were rather coarse--broad, with squat fingers": 787, " strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm": 788, " the nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point": 789, " as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me, i could not repress a shudder": 790, " it may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what i would, i could not conceal": 791, " the count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace": 792, " we were both silent for a while; and as i looked towards the window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn": 793, " there seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as i listened i heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves": 794, " the count\u2019s eyes gleamed, and he said:-- \"listen to them--the children of the night": 795, " what music they make!\" seeing, i suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added:-- \"ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter": 796, "\" then he rose and said:-- \"but you must be tired": 797, " your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you shall sleep as late as you will": 798, " i have to be away till the afternoon; so sleep well and dream well!\" with a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and i entered my bedroom": 799, " i am all in a sea of wonders": 800, " i doubt; i fear; i think strange things, which i dare not confess to my own soul": 801, " god keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!

costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order": 813, " i saw something like them in hampton court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten": 814, " but still in none of the rooms is there a mirror": 815, " there is not even a toilet glass on my table, and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair": 816, " i have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves": 817, " some time after i had finished my meal--i do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o\u2019clock when i had it--i looked about for something to read, for i did not like

them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers": 821, " a table in the centre was littered with english magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date": 822, " the books were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to england and english life and customs and manners": 823, " there were even such books of reference as the london directory, the \"red\" and \"blue\" books, whitaker\u2019s almanac, the army and navy lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the law list": 824, " whilst

invaders": 857, " in old days there were stirring times, when the austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches": 858, " when the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil": 859, "\" \"but how,\" said i, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\" the count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:-- \"because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! those flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors": 860, " and, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do": 861,

dark": 868, " the lamps were also lit in the study or library, and i found the count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an english bradshaw\u2019s guide": 869, " when i came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him i went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts": 870, " he was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place

had made at the time, and which i inscribe here:-- \"at purfleet, on a by-road, i came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale": 878, " it is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years": 879, " the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust": 880, " \"the estate is called carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _quatre face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass":

dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream": 883, " the house is very large and of all periods back, i should say, to medi\u00e6val times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron": 884, " it looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church": 885, " i could not enter it, as i had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but i have taken with my kodak views of it from various points": 886, " the house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great": 887, " there are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only

was getting very late indeed, but i did not say anything, for i felt under obligation to meet my host\u2019s wishes in every way": 911, " i was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide": 912, " they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it": 913, " all at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; count dracula, jumping to his feet, said:-- \"why, there is the morning again! how remiss i am to let you stay up so long": 914, " you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of england less interesting, so that i may not forget how time flies by us,\" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me": 915, " i went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all i could see was the warm grey of quickening

moment": 930, " having answered the count\u2019s salutation, i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken": 931, " this time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and i could see him over my shoulder": 932, " but there was no reflection of him in the mirror! the whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself": 933, " this was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near; but at the instant i saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin": 934, " i laid down the razor, turning as i did so half round to look for some sticking plaster": 935, " when the count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat": 936, " i drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix": 937, " it made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there": 938, " \"take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself": 939, " it is more dangerous

drink": 948, " he must be a very peculiar man! after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle": 949, " i went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the south": 950, " the view was magnificent, and from where i stood there was every opportunity of seeing it": 951, " the castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice": 952, " a stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything! as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm": 953, " here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests": 954, " but i am not in heart to describe beauty, for when i had seen the view i explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted": 955, " in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit": 956, " the castle is a veritable prison, and i am a prisoner! chapter iii jonathan harker\u2019s

but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings": 958, " when i look back after a few hours i think i must have been mad for the time, for i behaved much as a rat does in a trap": 959, " when, however, the conviction had come to me that i was helpless i sat down quietly--as quietly as i have ever done anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done": 960, " i am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion": 961, " of one thing only am i certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to the count": 962, " he knows well that i am imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with the facts": 963, " so far as i can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open": 964, " i am, i know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else i am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, i need, and shall need, all my brains to get through": 965, " i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below shut, and knew that the count had returned": 966, " he did not come at once into the library, so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed": 967, " this was odd, but only confirmed what i had all along thought--that there were no servants in the house": 968, " when later i saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, i was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them": 969, " this gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here": 970, " this is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence": 971, " how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? what meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it": 972, " it is odd that a thing which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help": 973, " is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? some time, if it may be, i must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it": 974, " in the meantime i must find out all i can about count dracula, as it may help me to understand": 975, " to-night he may talk of himself, if i turn the conversation that way": 976, " i must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion": 977, "_--i have had a long talk with

as if he had been present at them all": 980, " this he afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate": 981, " whenever he spoke of his house he always said \"we,\" and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking": 982, " i wish i could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for

grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength": 985, " one thing he said which i shall put down as nearly as i can; for it tells in its way the story of his race:-- \"we szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship": 986, " here, in the whirlpool of european races, the ugric tribe bore down from iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them, which their berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe, ay, and of asia and africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come": 987, " here, too, when they came, they found the huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the desert": 988, " fools, fools! what devil or what witch was ever so great as attila, whose blood is in these veins?\" he held up his arms": 989, " \"is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the magyar, the lombard, the avar, the bulgar, or the turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? is it strange that when arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the honfoglalas was completed there? and when the hungarian flood swept eastward, the szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the turks say, \u2019water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless": 990, "\u2019 who more gladly than we throughout the four nations received the \u2019bloody sword,\u2019 or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king? when was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of cassova, when the flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent? who was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground? this was a dracula indeed! woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! was it not this dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! they said that he thought only of himself": 991, " bah! what good are peasants without a leader? where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? again, when, after the battle of moh\u00e1cs, we threw off the hungarian yoke, we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free": 992, " ah, young sir, the szekelys--and the dracula as their heart\u2019s blood, their brains, and their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach": 993, " the warlike days are over": 994, " blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and

count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business": 1001, " i had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters i had been examined in at lincoln\u2019s inn": 1002, " there was a certain method in the count\u2019s inquiries, so i shall try to put them down in sequence;

it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest": 1005, " he seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor": 1006, " i asked him to explain more fully, so that i might not by any chance mislead him, so he said:-- \"i shall illustrate": 1007, "

good! now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that i have sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only; and as one of london residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, i went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest": 1010, " now, suppose i, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to newcastle, or durham, or harwich, or dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\" i answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble": 1011, " \"but,\" said he, \"i could be at liberty to direct myself": 1012, " is it not so?\" \"of course,\" i replied; and \"such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one

forethought could be guarded against": 1014, " i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee": 1015, " for a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful": 1016, " when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and i had verified all as well as i could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said:--

by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where i imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the count\u2019s own room would look out": 1062, " the window at which i stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there": 1063, " i drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out": 1064, " what i saw was the count\u2019s head coming out from the window": 1065, " i did not see the face, but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms": 1066, " in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had so many opportunities of studying": 1067, " i was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner": 1068, " but my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, _face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings": 1069, " at first i could not believe my eyes": 1070, " i thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but i kept looking, and it could be no delusion": 1071, " i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall": 1072, " what manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man? i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me; i am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; i am encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of": 1073, " * * * * * _15 may": 1074, "_--once more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion": 1075, " he moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left": 1076, " he vanished into some hole or window": 1077, " when his head had disappeared, i leaned out to try and see more, but without avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight": 1078, " i knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than i had dared to do as yet": 1079, " i went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors": 1080, " they were all locked, as i had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but i went down the stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally": 1081, " i found i could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone! that key must be in the count\u2019s room; i must watch should his door be unlocked, so that i may get it and escape": 1082, " i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them": 1083, " one or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten": 1084, " at last, however, i found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure": 1085, " i tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor": 1086, " here was an opportunity which i might not have again, so i exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that i could enter": 1087, " i was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms i knew and a storey lower down": 1088, " from the windows i could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south": 1089, " on the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice": 1090, " the castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured": 1091, " to the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone": 1092, " this was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any i had seen": 1093, " the windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth": 1094, " my lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but i was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble": 1095, " still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the presence of the count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, i found a soft quietude come over me": 1096, " here i am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last": 1097, " it is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance": 1098, " and yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere \"modernity\" cannot kill": 1099, " * * * * * _later: the morning of 16

dreadful to me; that to him alone i can look for safety, even though this be only whilst i can serve his purpose": 1104, " great god! merciful god! let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed": 1105, " i begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me": 1106, " up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant when he made hamlet say:-- \"my tablets! quick, my

moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me": 1114, " i determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars": 1115, " i drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as i lay, i could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep": 1116, " i suppose i must have fallen asleep; i hope so, but i fear, for all that followed was startlingly real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep": 1117, " i was not alone": 1118, " the room was the same, unchanged in any way since i came into it; i could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of dust": 1119, " in the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner": 1120, " i thought at the time that i must be dreaming when i saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor": 1121, " they came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together": 1122, " two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon": 1123, " the other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires": 1124, " i seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but i could not recollect at the moment how or where": 1125, " all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips": 1126, " there was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear": 1127, " i felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips": 1128, " it is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet mina\u2019s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth": 1129, " they whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips": 1130, " it was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand": 1131, " the fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on": 1132, " one said:-- \"go on! you are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin": 1133, "\" the other added:-- \"he is young and strong;

offensiveness, as one smells in blood": 1137, " i was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes": 1138, " the girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating": 1139, " there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth": 1140, " lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat": 1141, " then she paused, and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck": 1142, " then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one\u2019s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer": 1143, " i could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there": 1144, " i closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating heart": 1145, " but at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning": 1146, " i was conscious of the presence of the count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury": 1147, "

with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion": 1148, " but the count! never did i imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit": 1149, " his eyes were positively blazing": 1150, " the red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them": 1151, " his face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal": 1152, " with a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the wolves": 1153, " in a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:-- \"how dare you touch him, any of you? how dare you cast eyes on him when i had forbidden it? back, i tell you all! this man belongs to me! beware how you meddle with him, or you\u2019ll have to deal with me": 1154, "\" the fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:-- \"you yourself never loved; you never love!\" on this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure of fiends": 1155, " then the count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:-- \"yes, i too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past": 1156, " is it not so? well, now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall kiss him at your will": 1157, " now go! go! i must awaken him, for there is work to be done": 1158, "\" \"are we to have nothing to-night?\" said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag

from far and wide by the howling of wolves": 1288, " before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard": 1289, "

furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust": 1320, " i looked for the key, but it

greek and turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground": 1322, " none of it that i noticed was less than three hundred years old": 1323, " there were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained": 1324, " at one corner of the room was a heavy door": 1325, " i tried it, for, since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, i must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain": 1326, " it was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down": 1327, " i descended, minding carefully where i went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry": 1328, " at the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned": 1329, " as i went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier": 1330, " at last i pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard": 1331, " the roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the slovaks": 1332, " there was nobody about, and i made search for any further outlet, but there was none": 1333, " then i went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance": 1334, " i went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul": 1335, " into two of these i went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, i made a discovery": 1336, " there, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the count! he was either dead or asleep, i could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever": 1337, " but there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart": 1338, " i bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain": 1339, " he could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours": 1340, " by the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there": 1341, " i thought he might have the keys on him, but when i went to search i saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that i fled from the place, and leaving the count\u2019s room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall": 1342, " regaining my room, i threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think": 1343, " * * * * * _29 june": 1344, "_--to-day is the date of my last letter, and the count has taken

weapon, that i might destroy him; but i fear that no weapon wrought alone by man\u2019s hand would have any effect on him": 1346, " i dared not wait to see him return, for i feared to see those weird

moment against the count was useless": 1373, " with such allies as these at his command, i could do nothing": 1374, " but still the door continued slowly to open, and only the count\u2019s body stood

the idea great enough for the count, and as a last chance i cried out:-- \"shut the door; i shall wait till morning!\" and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment":

renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck": 1410, " even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated": 1411, " it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood": 1412, " he lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion": 1413, " i shuddered as i

drive me mad": 1418, " this was the being i was helping to transfer to london, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless": 1419, " the very thought drove me mad": 1420, " a terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster": 1421, " there was no lethal weapon at hand, but i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face": 1422, " but as i did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror": 1423, " the sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead": 1424, " the shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight": 1425, " the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell": 1426, " i thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and i waited with a despairing feeling growing over me": 1427, " as i waited i heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count had spoken were coming": 1428, " with a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, i ran from the place and gained the count\u2019s room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened": 1429, "

one had a key for one of the locked doors": 1431, " then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo": 1432, " i turned to run down again towards the vault, where i might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying": 1433, " when i ran to push it open, i found that it was hopelessly fast": 1434, " i was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely": 1435, " as i write

it is the box being nailed down": 1437, " now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them": 1438, " the door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key in the lock; i can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and shuts; i hear the creaking of lock and bolt": 1439, " hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way

1955, "\" then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before": 1956, " the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the east pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless": 1957, " the wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour": 1958, " the searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship": 1959, " no other form could be seen on deck at all": 1960, " a great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! however, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words": 1961, " the schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the east cliff, known locally as tate hill pier": 1962, " there was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap": 1963, " every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the \"top-hammer\" came crashing down": 1964, " but, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand": 1965, " making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones--\"thruff-steans\" or \"through-stones,\" as they call them in the whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight": 1966, " it so happened that there was no one at the moment on tate hill pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above": 1967, " thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board": 1968, " the men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there": 1969, " the coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion": 1970, " this seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run": 1971, " it is a good way round from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd": 1972, " when i arrived, however, i found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board": 1973, " by the courtesy of the chief boatman, i was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel": 1974, " it was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen": 1975, " the man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel": 1976, " between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords": 1977, " the poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone": 1978, " accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor--surgeon j": 1979, " caffyn, of 33, east

for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log": 1981, " the coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth": 1982, " the fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the admiralty court; for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict": 1983, " already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_": 1984, " it is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as noble as that of the young casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to await inquest": 1985, " already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating; crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the yorkshire wolds": 1986, " i

laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour--for it was now ten o\u2019clock--and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response": 3469, " hitherto i had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me": 3470, " was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? was it indeed a house of death to which i had come, too late? i knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses; and i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entry anywhere": 3471, " i could find no means of ingress": 3472, " every window and door was fastened and locked, and i returned baffled to the porch": 3473,

me, he gasped out:-- \"then it was you, and just arrived": 3476, " how is she? are we too late? did you not get my telegram?\" i answered as quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that i could not make any one in the house hear me": 3477, " he paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:-- \"then i

opened the window": 3485, " i helped the professor in, and followed him": 3486, " there was no one in the kitchen or in the servants\u2019 rooms, which were close at hand": 3487, " we tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor": 3488, " there was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition": 3489, " van helsing and i looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: \"we can attend to them later": 3490, "\" then we ascended to lucy\u2019s room": 3491, " for an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear": 3492, " with white faces and

was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it": 3495, " by her side lay lucy, with face white and still more drawn": 3496, " the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother\u2019s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled": 3497, " without a word the professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor lucy\u2019s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:-- \"it is not yet too late! quick! quick! bring the brandy!\" i flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i found on the table": 3498, " the maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and i fancied that the narcotic was wearing off": 3499, " i did not stay to make sure, but returned to van helsing": 3500, " he rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her

prepared fire and water": 3513, " fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water": 3514, " we got a bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it": 3515, " whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door": 3516, " one of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it": 3517, " then she returned and

message, and, engrossed with our work, i clean forgot all about him": 3520, " i never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly earnest": 3521, " i knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so": 3522, " he answered me in a way that i did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:-- \"if that were all, i would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for i see no light in life over her horizon": 3523, "\" he went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour":

perceptible movement": 3526, " van helsing\u2019s face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:-- \"the first gain is ours! check to the king!\" we took lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat": 3527, " i noticed that van helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat": 3528, " she was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her": 3529, " van helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room": 3530, " \"we must consult as to what is to be done,\" he said as we descended the stairs": 3531,

the professor watched whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting": 3561, " i left quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast": 3562, " then a thought struck me, and i went back to the room where lucy now was": 3563, " when i came softly in, i found van helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand": 3564, " he had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow": 3565, " there was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved": 3566, " he handed me the paper saying only: \"it dropped from lucy\u2019s breast when we carried her to the bath": 3567, "\" when i had read it, i stood looking at the professor, and after a pause asked him: \"in god\u2019s name, what does it all mean? was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\" i was so bewildered that i did not know what to say more": 3568, " van helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying:-- \"do not trouble about it now": 3569, " forget it for the present": 3570, " you shall know and understand it all in

up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements": 3585, " when i got back quincey was waiting for me": 3586, " i told him i would see him as soon as i knew about lucy, and went up

it, too--to keep him from breaking down": 3604, " i paused before answering, for i felt that i must not betray anything which the professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so i answered in the same phrase: \"that\u2019s so": 3605, "\" \"and how long has this been going on?\" \"about ten days": 3606, "\" \"ten

woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave": 4782, " we could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child": 4783, " there was a pause and a sharp little cry,

purity to voluptuous wantonness": 4789, " van helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb": 4790, " van helsing

next to me, and if i had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen": 4794, " when lucy--i call the thing that was before us lucy because it bore her shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us": 4795, " lucy\u2019s eyes in form and colour; but lucy\u2019s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew": 4796, " at that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, i could have done it with savage delight": 4797, " as she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile": 4798, " oh, god, how it made me shudder to see it! with a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as

lamp, which had now no quiver from van helsing\u2019s iron nerves": 4811, " never did i see such baffled malice on a face; and never, i trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes": 4812, "

callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come

indexy kind of way that i am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads": 5538, " i can\u2019t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth": 5539, " besides, he called the count \u2019lord and master,\u2019 and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way": 5540, " that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so i suppose he isn\u2019t above trying to use a respectable lunatic": 5541, " he certainly did seem earnest, though": 5542, " i only hope we have done what is best":

the good god?\" lord godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned": 5547, " he held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked:-- \"that old place may be full of rats, and if so,

when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each": 5550, " then he spoke:-- \"my friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds": 5551, " our enemy is not merely spiritual": 5552, " remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not amenable to mere strength": 5553, " a stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him": 5554, " we must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch": 5555, " keep this near your heart\"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, i being nearest to him--\"put these flowers round your neck\"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms--\"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless": 5556, "\" this was a portion of sacred wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me": 5557, " each of the others was similarly equipped": 5558, " \"now,\" he said, \"friend john, where are the skeleton keys? if so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at miss lucy\u2019s": 5559, " seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead": 5560, " presently he got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back": 5561, " we pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened": 5562, " it was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in dr": 5563, " seward\u2019s diary of the opening of miss westenra\u2019s tomb; i fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back": 5564, " the professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door": 5565, " \"_in manus tuas, domine!_\" he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold": 5566, " we closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road": 5567, " the professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit": 5568, " then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search": 5569, " the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows": 5570, " i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us": 5571, " i suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in transylvania": 5572, " i think the feeling was common to us all, for i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as i felt myself doing": 5573, " the whole place was thick with dust": 5574, " the floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp i could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked": 5575, " the walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider\u2019s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down": 5576, " on a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each": 5577, " they had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the professor lifted them": 5578, " he turned to me and said:-- \"you know this place, jonathan": 5579, " you have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do": 5580, " which is the way to the chapel?\" i had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit i had not been able to get admission to it; so i led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands": 5581, " \"this is the spot,\" said the professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase": 5582, " with a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door": 5583, " we were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered": 5584, " none of the others had met the count at all at close quarters, and when i had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul": 5585, " there was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air": 5586, " but as to the odour itself, how shall i describe it? it was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt": 5587, " faugh! it sickens me to think of it": 5588, " every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness": 5589, " under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations": 5590, " after the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses": 5591, " we made an accurate examination of the place, the professor saying as we began:-- \"the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest": 5592, "\" a glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them": 5593, " there were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! once i got a fright, for, seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, i looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still": 5594, " somewhere, looking out from the shadow, i seemed to see the high lights of the count\u2019s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor": 5595, " it was only for a moment, for, as lord godalming said, \"i thought i saw a face, but it was only the shadows,\" and resumed his inquiry, i turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage": 5596, " there was no sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_": 5597, " i took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing": 5598, " a few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining": 5599, " we all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars": 5600, " we all instinctively drew back": 5601, " the whole place was becoming alive with rats": 5602, " for a moment or two we stood appalled, all save lord godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency": 5603, " rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which dr": 5604, " seward had described from the outside, and which i had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open": 5605, " then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call": 5606, " it was answered from behind dr": 5607, " seward\u2019s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house": 5608, " unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved i noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way": 5609, " but even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased": 5610, " they seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies": 5611, " the dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion": 5612, " the rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out": 5613, " lord godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor": 5614, " the instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies": 5615, " they fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished": 5616, " with their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes": 5617, " we all seemed to find our spirits rise": 5618, " whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open i know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution": 5619, " we closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house": 5620, " we found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit": 5621, " never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood": 5622, " the morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front": 5623, " van helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done": 5624, " \"so far,\" he said, \"our night has been eminently successful": 5625, " no harm has come to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing": 5626, " more than all do i rejoice that this, our first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget": 5627, " one lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute beasts which are to the count\u2019s command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother\u2019s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend arthur": 5628, " we have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night": 5629, " so be it that he has gone elsewhere": 5630, " good! it has given us opportunity to cry \u2019check\u2019 in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls": 5631, " and now let us go home": 5632, " the dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night\u2019s work": 5633, " it may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink": 5634, "\" the house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from renfield\u2019s room": 5635, " the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain": 5636,

not upset her": 5639, " i am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations": 5640, " it is too great a strain for a woman to bear": 5641, " i did not think so at first, but i know better now": 5642, " therefore i am glad that it is settled": 5643, " there may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment": 5644, " henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world": 5645, " i daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours; but i must be resolute, and to-morrow i

wife": 6233, " by her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black": 6234, " his face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead": 6235, " with his left hand he held both mrs": 6236, " harker\u2019s hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom": 6237, " her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man\u2019s bare breast which was shown by his torn-open dress": 6238, " the attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten\u2019s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink": 6239, " as we burst into the room, the count turned his face, and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap into it": 6240, " his eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast": 6241, " with a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us": 6242, " but by this time the professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred wafer": 6243, " the count suddenly stopped, just as poor lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back": 6244, " further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced": 6245, " the moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under quincey\u2019s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour": 6246, " this, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position": 6247, " van helsing, art, and i moved forward to mrs": 6248, " harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day": 6249, " for a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray": 6250, " her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror": 6251, " then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the count\u2019s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief": 6252, " van helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room": 6253, " van helsing whispered to me:-- \"jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce": 6254, " we can do nothing with poor madam mina for a few moments till she recovers herself; i must wake him!\" he dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the

few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up": 6260, " his wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as

god\u2019s name what does this mean?\" harker cried out": 6262, " seward, dr": 6263, " van helsing, what is it? what has happened? what is wrong? mina, dear, what is it? what does that blood mean? my god, my god! has it come to this!\" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together": 6264, " \"good god help us! help her! oh, help her!\" with a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion": 6265, " \"what has happened? tell me all about it!\" he cried without pausing": 6266, " van helsing,

god knows, without the dread of his harming you": 6271, " you must stay with me": 6272, " stay with these friends who will watch over you!\" her expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he

unclean! i must touch him or kiss him no more": 6280, " oh, that it should be that it is i who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear": 6281, "\" to this he spoke out

punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\" he put out his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there sobbing": 6285, " he looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel": 6286, " after a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which i felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:-- \"and now, dr": 6287, " seward, tell me all about it": 6288, " too well i know the broad fact; tell me all that has been": 6289, "\" i told him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as i told how

at the door": 6292, " they entered in obedience to our summons": 6293, " van helsing looked at me questioningly": 6294, " i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to

could understand out of my experience in transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the count\u2019s extraordinary power": 6476, " i had to give in,

of our teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with

incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respective probability of its details": 7174, " it is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know least, and talk most": 7175, " homer, socrates, and shakespere(1) have, perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow": 7176, " the personality of shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty": 7177, " of socrates we know as little as the contradictions of plato and xenophon will allow us to know": 7178, " he was one of the _dramatis personae_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style": 7179, " he appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down": 7180, " when we have read plato _or_ xenophon, we think we know something of socrates; when we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant": 7181, " it has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief": 7182, " this system--which has often comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of strauss for those of the new testament--has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries": 7183, " to question the existence of alexander the great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in that of romulus": 7184, " to deny a fact related in herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom the elegant pen of florian has idealized--_numa pompilius": 7185, "_ scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to homer, and the state of our homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the iliad and odyssey": 7186, " what few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle": 7187, " \"this cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true": 7188, "\" such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and oblivion": 7189, " it is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of homer are partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which truth is the requisite most wanting": 7190, " before taking a brief review of the homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken of the treatise on the life of homer which has been attributed to herodotus": 7191, " according to this document, the city of cumae in \u0107olia, was, at an early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of greece": 7192, " among the immigrants was menapolus, the son of ithagenes": 7193, " although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named critheis": 7194, " the girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of cleanax, of argos": 7195, " it is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we \"are indebted for so much happiness": 7196, "\" homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of melesigenes, from having been born near the river meles, in boeotia, whither critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation": 7197, " \"at this time,\" continues our narrative, \"there lived at smyrna a man named phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married, engaged critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours": 7198, " so satisfactory was her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were carefully brought up": 7199, "\" they were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed, and melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom": 7200, " phemius died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed": 7201, " melesigenes carried on his adopted father\u2019s school with great success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city": 7202, " among these visitors, one mentes, from leucadia, the modern santa maura, who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his travels": 7203, " he promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that, \"while he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses": 7204, "\" melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron, \"examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met": 7205, "\" we may also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation(2) having set sail from tyrrhenia and iberia, they reached ithaca": 7206, " here melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and mentes, who was about to leave for leucadia, left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his, named mentor, the son of alcinor": 7207, " under his hospitable and intelligent host, melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting ulysses, which afterwards formed the subject of the odyssey": 7208, " the inhabitants of ithaca assert, that it was here that melesigenes became blind, but the colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune": 7209, " he then returned to smyrna, where he applied himself to the study of poetry": 7210, "(3) but poverty soon drove him to cumae": 7211, " having passed over the hermaean plain, he arrived at neon teichos, the new wall, a colony of cumae": 7212, " here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one tychias, an armourer": 7213, " \"and up to my time,\" continued the author, \"the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot": 7214, " here also a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since melesigenes arrived\"": 7215, "(4) but poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of larissa, as being the most convenient road": 7216, " here, the cumans say, he composed an epitaph on gordius, king of phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability, been attributed to cleobulus of lindus": 7217, "(5) arrived at cumae, he frequented the _converzationes_(6) of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his poetry": 7218, " encouraged by this favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously renowned": 7219, " they avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council": 7220, " having made the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal": 7221, " the greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet\u2019s demand, but one man observed that \"if they were to feed _homers,_ they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people": 7222, "\" \"from this circumstance,\" says the writer, \"melesigenes acquired the name of homer, for the cumans call blind men _homers": 7223, "_\"(7) with a love of economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory": 7224, " at phocoea, homer was destined to experience another literary distress": 7225, " one thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name": 7226, " having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable, thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him": 7227, " at his departure, homer is said to have observed: \"o thestorides, of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart": 7228, "\"(8) homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some chian merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite, acquainted him with the fact that thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems": 7229, " this at once determined him to set out for chios": 7230, " no vessel happened then to be setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for erythrae, a town of ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them": 7231, " having embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of jove the hospitable": 7232, " at erythrae, homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached the little hamlet of pithys": 7233, " here he met with an adventure, which we will continue in the words of our author": 7234, " \"having set out from pithys, homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing": 7235, " the dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out": 7236, " glaucus (for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from homer": 7237, " for or some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what could be his design in coming": 7238, " he then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need": 7239, " homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him sup": 7240, "(9) \"the dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to their usual habit": 7241, " whereupon homer addressed glaucus thus: o glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest": 7242, " first give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold": 7243, " glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author": 7244, " having finished supper, they banqueted(10) afresh on conversation, homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited": 7245, " at length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, glaucus resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with homer": 7246, " having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left homer at home, promising to return quickly": 7247, " having arrived at bolissus, a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole story respecting homer and his journey": 7248, " he paid little attention to what he said, and blamed glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons": 7249, " however, he bade him bring the stranger to him": 7250, " glaucus told homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuring him that good fortune would be the result": 7251, " conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the charge of his children": 7252, "(11) besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor thestorides from the island, homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher": 7253, " in the town of chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry": 7254, " \"to this day,\" says chandler,(12) \"the most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason, the school of homer": 7255, " it is on the coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have been an open temple of cybele, formed on the top of a rock": 7256, " the shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting": 7257, " she is represented, as usual, sitting": 7258, " the chair has a lion carved on each side, and on the back": 7259, " the area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over": 7260, " the whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote antiquity": 7261, "\" so successful was this school, that homer realised a considerable fortune": 7262, " he married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single, the other married a chian": 7263, " the following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already been mentioned:-- \"in his poetical compositions homer displays great gratitude towards mentor of ithaca, in the odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of ulysses,(13) in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness": 7264, " he also testifies his gratitude to phemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction": 7265, "\" his celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to visit greece, whither his reputation had now extended": 7266, " having, it is said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,(14) he sent out for samos": 7267, " here being recognized by a samian, who had met with him in chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the apaturian festival": 7268, " he recited some verses, which gave great satisfaction, and by singing the eiresione at the new moon festivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he was very popular": 7269, " in the spring he sailed for athens, and arrived at the island of ios, now ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died": 7270, " it is said that his death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermen\u2019s children": 7271, "(15) such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of homer we possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail": 7272, " let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering, patient, and learned--but by no means consistent--series of investigations has led": 7273, " in doing so, i profess to bring forward statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability": 7274, " \"homer appeared": 7275, " the history of this poet and his works is lost in doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness": 7276, " the majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed": 7277, "\" such are the words in which one of the most judicious german critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the homeric question is involved": 7278, " with no less truth and feeling he proceeds:-- \"it seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible": 7279, " if the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light": 7280, " the creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of observation": 7281, " if we were in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet": 7282, "\" (16) from this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue": 7283, " was homer an individual?(17) or were the iliad and odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets? well has landor remarked: \"some tell us there were twenty homers; some deny that there was ever one": 7284, " it were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last": 7285, " we are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion to superior power": 7286, " of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us": 7287, " my opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of good": 7288, " no man living venerates homer more than i do": 7289, "\" (18) but, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis--our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the homeric question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry details": 7290, " before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the homeric poems, (at least of the iliad,) i must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks:-- \"we cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better, the poetic age of greece, almost conclusive testimony to its original composition": 7291, " it was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole": 7292, " the most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the opinion of chantrey or westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form, rather than that of mr": 7293, " brodie or sir astley cooper": 7294, " \"there is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines of pope": 7295, "-- \"\u2019the critic eye--that microscope of wit sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit, how parts relate to parts, or they to whole the body\u2019s harmony, the beaming soul, are things which kuster, burmann, wasse, shall see, when man\u2019s whole frame is obvious to a flea": 7296, "\u2019\"(19) long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems": 7297, " the grave and cautious thucydides quoted without hesitation the hymn to apollo,(20) the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics": 7298, " longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the odyssey to the iliad,(21) and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names(22) it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of homer ever arose": 7299, " so far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim": 7300, " at the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the subject, and we find bentley remarking that \"homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment": 7301, " these loose songs were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about peisistratus\u2019 time, about five hundred years after": 7302, "\"(23) two french writers--hedelin and perrault--avowed a similar scepticism on the subject; but it is in the \"scienza nuova\" of battista vico, that we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by wolf with so much learning and acuteness": 7303, " indeed, it is with the wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of grote(24)-- \"half a century ago, the acute and valuable prolegomena of f": 7304, " wolf, turning to account the venetian scholia, which had then been recently published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the homeric text": 7305, " a considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced by bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the iliad and odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of peisistratus, in the sixth century before christ": 7306, " as a step towards that conclusion, wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to posterity": 7307, " the absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early greeks, was thus one of the points in wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey": 7308, " by nitzsch, and other leading opponents of wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the iliad and odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning": 7309, " \"to me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by wolf to peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the homeric poems, are nowise admissible": 7310, " but much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in the ninth century before the christian aera": 7311, " few things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and mr": 7312, " payne knight, opposed as he is to the wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than wolf himself": 7313, " the traces of writing in greece, even in the seventh century before the christian aera, are exceedingly trifling": 7314, " we have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth olympiad, and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure ourselves whether archilochus, simonides of amorgus, kallinus, tyrtaeus, xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar": 7315, " the first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of homer, is in the famous ordinance of solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the panathenaea: but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are unable to say": 7316, " \"those who maintain the homeric poems to have been written from the beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry--for they admit generally that the iliad and odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,--but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems--the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy": 7317, " but here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory, (25) is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious": 7318, " moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the example of demodokus, in the odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of chios, in the hymn to the delian apollo, whom thucydides, as well as the general tenor of grecian legend, identifies with homer himself": 7319, " the author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest": 7320, "\" the loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon which even the acumen of bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of the greek language had undergone a considerable change": 7321, " now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved": 7322, " if chaucer\u2019s poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more like the effeminate version of dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble original": 7323, " \"at what period,\" continues grote, \"these poems, or indeed any other greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of solon": 7324, " if, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any more determinate period, the question a once suggests itself, what were the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer? for whom was a written iliad necessary? not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce": 7325, " not for the general public--they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival": 7326, " the only persons for whom the written iliad would be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter": 7327, " incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and there was in early greece, a time when no such reading class existed": 7328, " if we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing": 7329, " now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the christian aera (b": 7330, " 660 to b": 7331, " 630), the age of terpander, kallinus, archilochus, simonides of amorgus, &c": 7332, " i ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of grecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life": 7333, " such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the nearest approaching to the sense)": 7334, " it argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their own individual point of view, the written words of the homeric rhapsodies, just as we are told that kallinus both noticed and eulogized the thebais as the production of homer": 7335, " there seems, therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the homeric poems and other old epics,--the thebais and the cypria, as well as the iliad and the odyssey,--began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century (b": 7336, " 1); and the opening of egypt to grecian commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon": 7337, " a reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes": 7338, "\"(26) but even peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations-- \"there are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion, throw some suspicion over the whole history of the peisistratid compilation, at least over the theory, that the iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the athenian ruler": 7339, " if the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if stesichorus, anacreon, and simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the iliad and odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible, that stronger marks of athenian manufacture should not remain": 7340, " whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our bentleys, to whom the name of helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age, however mr": 7341, " knight may have failed in reducing the homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics--still it is difficult to suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression": 7342, " it is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original, as sir walter scott has done in his continuation of sir tristram": 7343, " \"if, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total absence of athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation": 7344, " in later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times, the athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors": 7345, " but, amid all the traditions of the glories of early greece embodied in the iliad, the athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part": 7346, " even the few passages which relate to their ancestors, mr": 7347, " knight suspects to be interpolations": 7348, " it is possible, indeed, that in its leading outline, the iliad may be true to historic fact, that in the great maritime expedition of western greece against the rival and half-kindred empire of the laomedontiadae, the chieftain of thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have been the most important ally of the peloponnesian sovereign; the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the athenians to yield to their taste": 7349, " the songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an athenian synod of compilers of ancient song, than an achilleid or an olysseid": 7350, " could france have given birth to a tasso, tancred would have been the hero of the jerusalem": 7351, " if, however, the homeric ballads, as they are sometimes called, which related the wrath of achilles, with all its direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,--it is still surprising, that throughout the whole poem the _callida junctura_ should never betray the workmanship of an athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours, the french, should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors--or, at least, to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age": 7352, "\"(27) to return to the wolfian theory": 7353, " while it is to be confessed, that wolf\u2019s objections to the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis": 7354, " nor is lachmann\u2019s(28) modification of his theory any better": 7355, " he divides the first twenty-two books of the iliad into sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of peisistratus": 7356, " this, as grote observes, \"explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else": 7357, "\" moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the secession of achilles: elphenor, chief of the euboeans; tlepolemus, of the rhodians; pandarus, of the lycians; odius, of the halizonians; pirous and acamas, of the thracians": 7358, " none of these heroes again make their appearance, and we can but agree with colonel mure, that \"it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel": 7359, "\" the discrepancy, by which pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the fifth book, weeps at his son\u2019s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation": 7360, " grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the wolfian theory, and of lachmann\u2019s modifications with the character of peisistratus": 7361, " but he has also shown, and we think with equal success, that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems, or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct": 7362, " in short, \"a man may believe the iliad to have been put together out of pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of peisistratus as the period of its first compilation": 7363, "\" the friends or literary _employes_ of peisistratus must have found an iliad that was already ancient, and the silence of the alexandrine critics respecting the peisistratic \"recension,\" goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts they examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of attention": 7364, " \"moreover,\" he continues, \"the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked": 7365, " there is nothing, either in the iliad or odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age of peisistratus--nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two centuries, in the greek language, the coined money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments, the close military array, the improved construction of ships, the amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of religious festivals, the oriental and egyptian veins of religion, &c": 7366, ", familiar to the latter epoch": 7367, " these alterations onomakritus, and the other literary friends of peisistratus, could hardly have failed to notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time, undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate": 7368, " everything in the two great homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than peisistratus": 7369, " indeed, even the interpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before christ, and may well have been heard by archilochus and kallinus--in some cases even by arktinus and hesiod--as genuine homeric matter(29) as far as the evidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the iliad and odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand (always allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations) in 776 b": 7370, ", our first trustworthy mark of grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of the homeric poems, considered in reference to grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the anti-historical character of the greeks, enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition": 7371, "\"(30) on the whole, i am inclined to believe, that the labours of peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, i must confess, that i can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours": 7372, " at the same time, so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the work of peisistratus, i am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that athenian(31) would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis": 7373, " i will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author": 7374, " suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject": 7375, " i cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to lycurgus, is little else than a version of the same story as that of peisistratus, while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the spartan confucius": 7376, " i will conclude this sketch of the homeric theories, with an attempt, made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency": 7377, " it is as follows:-- \"no doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to \u2019discourse in excellent music\u2019 among them": 7378, " many of these, like those of the negroes in the united states, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing around them": 7379, " but what was passing around them? the grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times": 7380, " ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation": 7381, " then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden": 7382, " tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably": 7383, " \"it was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of melesigenes, or moeonides, but most probably the former": 7384, " he saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own": 7385, " this poem now exists, under the title of the \u2019odyssea": 7386, "\u2019 the author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him": 7387, " he therefore called it the poem of homeros, or the collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2019a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so": 7388, "\u2019 \"while employed on the wild legend of odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of achilles and agamemnon": 7389, " his noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself, and the achilleis(32) grew under his hand": 7390, " unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the cid, into a chronicle history, named the iliad": 7391, " melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but, first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets, assemblies, and agoras": 7392, " however, solon first, and then peisistratus, and afterwards aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored the works of melesigenes homeros to their original integrity in a great measure": 7393, "\"(33) having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, i must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems": 7394, " to deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or enjoy these poems": 7395, " in maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author, be he homer or melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit,_ i feel conscious that, while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary": 7396, " the minutiae of verbal criticism i am far from seeking to despise": 7397, " indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt would be gross inconsistency": 7398, " but, while i appreciate its importance in a philological view, i am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic value, especially in poetry": 7399, " three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had they been suggested to the author by his maecenas or africanus, he would probably have adopted": 7400, " moreover, those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often least competent to carry out their own precepts": 7401, " grammarians are not poets by profession, but may be so _per accidens": 7402, "_ i do not at this moment remember two emendations on homer, calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from herodotus down to loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute points, without which our greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune": 7403, " but it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity": 7404, " binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand": 7405, " if we compare the theories of knight, wolf, lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of homer": 7406, " one rejects what another considers the turning-point of his theory": 7407, " one cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else": 7408, " nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty": 7409, " justus lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to seneca are by _four_ different authors": 7410, "(34) now, i will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology--a phraseology with which writers like boethius and saxo grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves--in their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be he seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more equally bad": 7411, " with equal sagacity, father hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the \u0107neid of virgil, and the satires of horace, were literary deceptions": 7412, " now, without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning--nay, the refined acuteness--which scholars, like wolf, have bestowed upon this subject, i must express my fears, that many of our modern homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity": 7413, " nor can i help thinking, that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the iliad and odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation": 7414, " i have already expressed my belief that the labours of peisistratus were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of homer may not have been abroad in his day, than that the poems of valerius flaccus and tibullus should have given so much trouble to poggio, scaliger, and others": 7415, " but, after all, the main fault in all the homeric theories is, that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals, and which are its most fitting judges": 7416, " the ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of homer, does too much violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of chios": 7417, " to believe the author of the iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus": 7418, " there is a catholicity, so to speak, in the very name of homer": 7419, " our faith in the author of the iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better": 7420, " while, however, i look upon the belief in homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring; while i can join with old ennius in believing in homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,--still i am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and embellishment": 7421, " but it is one thing to _use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem itself from such materials": 7422, " what consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result? a blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality": 7423, " in fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions--nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination": 7424, " but unless there be some grand pervading principle--some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the iliad can never come to the birth": 7425, " traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will require little acuteness to detect": 7426, " sensible as i am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as i must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it still seems to me that the homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained": 7427, " we are not by nature intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal": 7428, " were faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why god willed our ignorance on any matter": 7429, " but we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity": 7430, " and there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter": 7431, " long and habitual reading of homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover": 7432, " in reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the same sense of injury, as an achilles or a hector": 7433, " and if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of homer), we shall feel that the poems of homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song": 7434, " and it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old": 7435, " heeren, who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely observes:-- \"it was homer who formed the character of the greek nation": 7436, " no poet has ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen": 7437, " prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the greeks": 7438, " this is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy": 7439, " when lawgivers and sages appeared in greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they paid homage to his superior genius": 7440, " he held up before his nation the mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity and truth": 7441, " his poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature; on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which outweighs all others, the love of glory": 7442, " his songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which cherishes the same sympathies": 7443, " if it is granted to his immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down on his race, to see the nations from the fields of asia to the forests of hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had been called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness": 7444, "\"(35) can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the \"apotheosis of homer\"(36) is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association, how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? the more we read, and the more we think--think as becomes the readers of homer,--the more rooted becomes the conviction that the father of poetry gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire": 7445, " whatever were the means of its preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories, whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other": 7446, " as the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to homer, are not included in pope\u2019s translation, i will content myself with a brief account of the battle of the frogs and mice, from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice(37):-- \"this poem,\" says coleridge, \"is a short mock-heroic of ancient date": 7447, " the text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of homer\u2019s genius; others have attributed it to the same pigrees, mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was uncertain; so little did the greeks, before the age of the ptolemies, know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings": 7448, " as to this little poem being a youthful prolusion of homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the iliad itself; and even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste, which the history of every other people in europe, and of many in asia, has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the iliad, that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as much reason to homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the homeric age": 7449, " knight infers from the usage of the word deltos, \"writing tablet,\" instead of diphthera, \"skin,\" which, according to herod": 7450, " 5, 58, was the material employed by the asiatic greeks for that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of attic ingenuity; and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v": 7451, " 191) is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition": 7452, "\" having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in pope\u2019s design, i will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation, and on my own purpose in the present edition": 7453, " pope was not a grecian": 7454, " his whole education had been irregular, and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of ogilby": 7455, " it is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language": 7456, " hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation": 7457, " there are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which prove that pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original": 7458, " and in those days, what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present": 7459, " if something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet\u2019s meaning, his _words_ were less jealously sought for, and those who could read so good a poem as pope\u2019s iliad had fair reason to be satisfied": 7460, " it would be absurd, therefore, to test pope\u2019s translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text": 7461, " we must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itself,--a work which is as much a part of english literature as homer himself is of greek": 7462, " we must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old iliad, that once was our most cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because buttmann, loewe, and liddell have made us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being an adjective, and not a substantive": 7463, " far be it from us to defend the faults of pope, especially when we think of chapman\u2019s fine, bold, rough old english;--far be it from, us to hold up his translation as what a translation of homer _might_ be": 7464, " but we can still dismiss pope\u2019s iliad to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow": 7465, " as to the notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up without pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general reader": 7466, " having some little time since translated all the works of homer for another publisher, i might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the text": 7467, " but pope\u2019s version was no field for such a display; and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions, to notice occasionally _some_ departures from the original, and to give a few parallel passages from our english homer, milton": 7468, " in the latter task i cannot pretend to novelty, but i trust that my other annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be found to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit": 7469, " to write a commentary on homer is not my present aim; but if i have made pope\u2019s translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers, i shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished": 7470, " theodore alois buckley": 7471, " _christ church": 7472, "_ pope\u2019s preface to the iliad of homer homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever": 7473, " the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled": 7474, " nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry": 7475, " it is the invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can never attain to this": 7476, " it furnishes art with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but \"steal wisely:\" for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature": 7477, " whatever praises may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more entertained with": 7478, " and, perhaps, the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature": 7479, " our author\u2019s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater": 7480, " it is like a copious nursery, which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants, each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify": 7481, " if some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature": 7482, " it is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in homer, that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him": 7483, " what he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in action": 7484, " if a council be called, or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poet\u2019s imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a spectator": 7485, " the course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes, hoid\u2019 ar\u2019 isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito": 7486, " \"they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it": 7487, "\" it is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity": 7488, " exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this \"vivida vis animi,\" in a very few": 7489, " even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove": 7490, " nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour": 7491, " this fire is discerned in virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected from homer, more shining than fierce, but everywhere equal and constant: in lucan and statius it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: in milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from heaven: but in homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly": 7492, " i shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors": 7493, " this strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex": 7494, " it seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable": 7495, " that which aristotle calls \"the soul of poetry,\" was first breathed into it by homer, i shall begin with considering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and i speak of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction": 7496, " fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the marvellous": 7497, " the probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them": 7498, " of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, \"the return of ulysses, the settlement of the trojans in italy,\" or the like": 7499, " that of the iliad is the \"anger of achilles,\" the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet": 7500, " yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity": 7501, " the action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days": 7502, " virgil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both homer\u2019s poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his": 7503, " the other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time": 7504, " nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of story": 7505, " if he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up their forces in the same order": 7506, " if he has funeral games for patroclus, virgil has the same for anchises, and statius (rather than omit them) destroys the unity of his actions for those of archemorus": 7507, " if ulysses visit the shades, the \u0107neas of virgil and scipio of silius are sent after him": 7508, " if he be detained from his return by the allurements of calypso, so is \u0107neas by dido, and rinaldo by armida": 7509, " if achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem, rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account": 7510, " if he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, virgil and tasso make the same present to theirs": 7511, " virgil has not only observed this close imitation of homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the want from other greek authors": 7512, " thus the story of sinon, and the taking of troy, was copied (says macrobius) almost word for word from pisander, as the loves of dido and \u0107neas are taken from those of medea and jason in apollonius, and several others in the same manner": 7513, " to proceed to the allegorical fable--if we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us! how fertile will that imagination appear, which as able to clothe all the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! this is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with homer, and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it": 7514, " for when the mode of learning changed in the following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it was in homer to make use of it": 7515, " and perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for virgil, that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem": 7516, " the marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the machines of the gods": 7517, " if homer was not the first who introduced the deities (as herodotus imagines) into the religion of greece, he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods, constantly laying their accusation against homer as the chief support of it": 7518, " but whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set: every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry": 7519, " we come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them": 7520, " every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by their manners": 7521, " nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices": 7522, " the single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the iliad": 7523, " that of achilles is furious and intractable; that of diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that of ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of hector, active and vigilant: the courage of agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition; that of menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we find in idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in sarpedon a gallant and generous one": 7524, " nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one": 7525, " for example: the main characters of ulysses and nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural, open, and regular": 7526, " but they have, besides, characters of courage; and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other upon experience": 7527, " it would be endless to produce instances of these kinds": 7528, " the characters of virgil are far from striking us in this open manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of homer": 7529, " his characters of valour are much alike; even that of turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing that differences the courage of mnestheus from that of sergestus, cloanthus, or the rest, in like manner it may be remarked of statius\u2019s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage courage appears in his capaneus, tydeus, hippomedon, &c": 7530, " they have a parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family": 7531, " i believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point, the invention of homer was to that of all others": 7532, " the speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters; being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners, of those who utter them": 7533, " as there is more variety of characters in the iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem": 7534, " \"everything in it has manner\" (as aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is acted or spoken": 7535, " it is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small a number of lines are employed in narration": 7536, " in virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any person\u2019s mouth upon the same occasion": 7537, " as many of his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety": 7538, " we oftener think of the author himself when we read virgil, than when we are engaged in homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests us less in the action described": 7539, " homer makes us hearers, and virgil leaves us readers": 7540, " if, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts": 7541, " longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part homer principally excelled": 7542, " what were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the scripture": 7543, " duport, in his gnomologia homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort": 7544, " and it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble; and that the roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad": 7545, " if we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the invention still predominant": 7546, " to what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat? nay, he not only gives us the full prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side views, unobserved by any painter but homer": 7547, " nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness, horror, and confusion": 7548, " it is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master": 7549, " if we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright imagination of homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it": 7550, " we acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught that \"language of the gods\" to men": 7551, " his expression is like the colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity": 7552, " it is, indeed, the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit": 7553, " aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out \"living words;\" there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever": 7554, " an arrow is \"impatient\" to be on the wing, a weapon \"thirsts\" to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in proportion to it": 7555, " it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter, as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more intense": 7556, " to throw his language more out of prose, homer seems to have affected the compound epithets": 7557, " this was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images": 7558, " on this last consideration i cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined": 7559, " we see the motion of hector\u2019s plumes in the epithet korythaiolos, the landscape of mount neritus in that of einosiphyllos, and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure": 7560, " as a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets is a short description": 7561, " lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also": 7562, " he was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of greece, but searched through its different dialects with this particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength": 7563, " what he most affected was the ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency": 7564, " with this he mingled the attic contractions, the broader doric, and the feebler \u0107olic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry": 7565, " thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified": 7566, " out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world": 7567, " this is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses, even without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of italian operas), will find more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of poetry": 7568, " the beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by virgil himself, though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the latin tongue: indeed the greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language": 7569, " virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense": 7570, " if the grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the roman, the only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than the other": 7571, " dionysius of halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author\u2019s beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the composition of words": 7572, " it suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make one imagine homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the muses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet": 7573, " they roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable": 7574, " thus on whatever side we contemplate homer, what principally strikes us is his invention": 7575, " it is that which forms the character of each part of his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and various": 7576, " i hope, in what has been said of virgil, with regard to any of these heads, i have no way derogated from his character": 7577, " nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole": 7578, " we ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him": 7579, " no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and as homer has done this in invention, virgil has in judgment": 7580, " not that we are to think that homer wanted judgment, because virgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that virgil wanted invention, because homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in comparison with one another": 7581, " homer was the greater genius, virgil the better artist": 7582, " in one we most admire the man, in the other the work": 7583, " homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; virgil leads us with an attractive majesty; homer scatters with a generous profusion; virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; homer, like the nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; virgil, like a river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream": 7584, " when we behold their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate": 7585, " homer, boundless and resistless as achilles, bears all before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; virgil, calmly daring, like \u0107neas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity": 7586, " and when we look upon their machines, homer seems like his own jupiter in his terrors, shaking olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens: virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his whole creation": 7587, " but after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins": 7588, " as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness": 7589, " if we look upon homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty": 7590, " among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of probability": 7591, " perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances": 7592, " thus homer has his \"speaking horses;\" and virgil his \"myrtles distilling blood;\" where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability": 7593, " it is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances": 7594, " the force of this faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one": 7595, " his similes are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects": 7596, " the same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images": 7597, " the reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind": 7598, " if there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in": 7599, " such are his grosser representations of the gods; and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but i must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of homer": 7600, " it must be a strange partiality to antiquity, to think with madame dacier,(38) \"that those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours": 7601, "\" who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? on the other side, i would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of homer engaged": 7602, " there is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses drawing water from the springs": 7603, " when we read homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him": 7604, " let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world": 7605, " by this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will become a satisfaction": 7606, " this consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the \"far-darting phoebus,\" the \"blue-eyed pallas,\" the \"swift-footed achilles,\" &c": 7607, ", which some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated": 7608, " those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit": 7609, " as for the epithets of great men, mons": 7610, " boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such; for the greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as alexander the son of philip, herodotus of halicarnassus, diogenes the cynic, &c": 7611, " homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry": 7612, " and, indeed, we have something parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of harold harefoot, edmund ironside, edward longshanks, edward the black prince, &c": 7613, " if yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition, i shall add a further conjecture": 7614, " hesiod, dividing the world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the brazen and the iron one, of \"heroes distinct from other men; a divine race who fought at thebes and troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of jupiter in the islands of the blessed": 7615, "\" now among the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families, actions or qualities": 7616, " what other cavils have been raised against homer, are such as hardly deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work": 7617, " many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much as heard of homer\u2019s having written first; a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye": 7618, " some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the \u0107neis to those of the iliad, for the same reasons which might set the odyssey above the \u0107neis; as that the hero is a wiser man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed; as because achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as \u0107neas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus that rapin judges in his comparison of homer and virgil": 7619, " others select those particular passages of homer which are not so laboured as some that virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of scaliger in his poetics": 7620, " others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of perrault in his parallels": 7621, " lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of homer, and that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of this principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of the cities, &c": 7622, ") to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his merit": 7623, " the same might as well be said of virgil, or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation": 7624, " this is the method of mons": 7625, " de la mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age homer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him": 7626, "(39) in all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers, he still continues superior to them": 7627, " a cooler judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment": 7628, " homer not only appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him": 7629, " what he has done admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation": 7630, " he showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything": 7631, " a work of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance": 7632, " having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief characteristic": 7633, " as far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions": 7634, " as it also breaks out in every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from this chief character": 7635, " it is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his proper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them": 7636, " it should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the greek": 7637, " it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern manners of expression": 7638, " if there be sometimes a darkness, there is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal": 7639, " i know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and i will venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author": 7640, " it is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular place": 7641, " it is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative; and it is what homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps": 7642, " where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic": 7643, " nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity": 7644, " methinks i see these different followers of homer, some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them": 7645, " however, of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the world will call dulness": 7646, " there is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all": 7647, " simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity": 7648, " this pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the scripture and our author": 7649, " one may affirm, with all respect to the inspired writings, that the divine spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that part of the world; and, as homer is the author nearest to those, his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer": 7650, " this consideration (together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks, induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the old testament; as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion": 7651, " for a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet": 7652, " they have something venerable, and as i may say, oracular, in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase": 7653, " perhaps the mixture of some graecisms and old words after the manner of milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to require a venerable, antique cast": 7654, " but certainly the use of modern terms of war and government, such as \"platoon, campaign, junto,\" or the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language": 7655, " there are two peculiarities in homer\u2019s diction, which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties": 7656, " i speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions": 7657, " many of the former cannot be done literally into english without destroying the purity of our language": 7658, " i believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an english compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their use of them; such as \"the cloud-compelling jove,\" &c": 7659, " as for the rest, whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one, the course to be taken is obvious": 7660, " some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translated literally \"leaf-shaking,\" but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis: \"the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods": 7661, "\" others that admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced": 7662, " for example, the epithet of apollo, hekaebolos or \"far-shooting,\" is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where apollo is represented as a god in person, i would use the former interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, i would make choice of the latter": 7663, " upon the whole, it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment": 7664, " as for homer\u2019s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or hemistitch": 7665, " i hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the other": 7666, " the repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or the like": 7667, " in other cases, i believe the best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is to answer for it": 7668, " it only remains to speak of the versification": 7669, " homer (as has been said) is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new subject": 7670, " this is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: i only know of homer eminent for it in the greek, and virgil in the latin": 7671, " i am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others": 7672, " few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who have, will see i have endeavoured at this beauty": 7673, " upon the whole, i must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to homer": 7674, " i attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done": 7675, " we have only those of chapman, hobbes, and ogilby": 7676, " chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his": 7677, " he has frequent interpolations of four or six lines; and i remember one in the thirteenth book of the odyssey, ver": 7678, " 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two": 7679, " he is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles": 7680, " he appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author; insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end": 7681, " his expression is involved in fustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the tragedy of bussy d\u2019amboise, &c": 7682, " in a word, the nature of the man may account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry": 7683, " his own boast, of having finished half the iliad in less than fifteen weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed": 7684, " but that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which is something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion": 7685, " hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often omits the most beautiful": 7686, " as for its being esteemed a close translation, i doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned": 7687, " he sometimes omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but through carelessness": 7688, " his poetry, as well as ogilby\u2019s, is too mean for criticism": 7689, " it is a great loss to the poetical world that mr": 7690, " dryden did not live to translate the iliad": 7691, " he has left us only the first book, and a small part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in": 7692, " he seems to have had too much regard to chapman, whose words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original": 7693, " however, had he translated the whole work, i would no more have attempted homer after him than virgil: his version of whom (notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language": 7694, " but the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it": 7695, " that which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry": 7696, " what i would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to consider him attentively in comparison with virgil above all the ancients, and with milton above all the moderns": 7697, " next these, the archbishop of cambray\u2019s telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author; and bossu\u2019s admirable treatise of the epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct": 7698, " but after all, with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning": 7699, " for to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that is not greek": 7700, " what i have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions i am prepared to learn; though i fear no judges so little as our best poets, who are most sensible of the weight of this task": 7701, " as for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers": 7702, " i was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit": 7703, " addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as i cannot repeat without vanity": 7704, " i was obliged to sir richard steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public": 7705, " swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend": 7706, "

undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection": 7713, " but what can i say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers? among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet: that his grace the duke of buckingham was not displeased i should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellent essay), so complete a praise: \"read homer once, and you can read no more; for all books else appear so mean, so poor, verse will seem prose: but still persist to read, and homer will be all the books you need": 7714, "\" that the earl of halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my lord bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of \"heroic love\" has continued his partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my attempting the iliad": 7715, " i cannot deny myself the pride of confessing, that i have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several particulars of this translation": 7716, " i could say a great deal of the pleasure of being

unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and i am satisfied i can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence": 7721, " in short, i have found more patrons than ever homer wanted": 7722, " he would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at athens that has been shown me by its learned rival, the university of oxford": 7723, " and i can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when i reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy friendships, which make the satisfaction of life": 7724, " this

may prove, i shall never repent of an undertaking in which i have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit; and in which i hope to pass some of those years of youth that are
